The tomato (/təmeɪtoʊ/ or /təmɑːtoʊ/) is the edible berry of the plant **Solanum  lycopersicum**, commonly known as the tomato plant. The species originated in western South America, Mexico, and Central America. The Nahuatl word *tomatl* gave rise to the Spanish word *tomate*, from which the English word tomato derives. Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread cultural interchange known as the Columbian exchange. From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.
